#  About Me:
I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at LNMIIT, merging hardware aerodynamics(DRONE) with software intelligence.

Robotics & Propulsion: I engineered a functional J79 Electric Jet Engine prototype featuring a custom afterburner for active thrust, alongside biomimetic ornithopter wings. I am a core member of the Phoenix Robotics Society.

Computer Vision & Code: My work includes real-time OpenCV systems such as Driver Drowsiness Alarms and Sign Language Detectors. I also explore cybersecurity with Cipher LNMIIT and contribute to Google Developer Groups.

Digital Design: I specialize in UI/UX and frontend development, building immersive 3D web environments that bridge the gap between mechanical logic and user interaction.
